1. First to check if the problem occurs, I did [/usr/bin/ls -A -a] 
and [/usr/bin/ls -a -A] and they both outputted the same thing and
 included . and .. (-a overrides)

2. To check the version of coreutils I did [ls --version] and saw 
that it was ls (GNU coreutils) 8.22

3. First I grabbed the coreutils source code by doing [wget 
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz], then 
signature [ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29
.tar.xz.sig], then keyring [wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg].

4. Next I verified using [gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg
 coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig]. There were no problems and it outputted
 "Good signature". But there was a warning that said "There is no 
indication that the signature belongs to the owner". This is 
because there is no way to validate the signature to the owner
 without using a digital certificate.

5. Next I installed coreutils by doing [./configure 
--prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/dhakshin/assign4/coreutilscopy] then [make]
 then [make install]. No problems occurred.

6. To verify if the problem still exists I did [/u/cs/ugrad/dhakshin
/assign4/coreutilscopy/bin/ls -a -A] and [/u/cs/ugrad/dhakshin/assign4
/coreutilscopy/bin/ls -A -a] and they both outputted the same thing and
 included . and .. (-a overrides)

7. Next I did [emacs patch.diff] and then pasted the contents of the patch 
in it. Next I did [patch -p1 < patch.diff] and clicked entered to skip parts
 of the patch text that are not part of the actual patch. -p1 strips everything
 until the first slash /.

8. Next I did [make] but it said that 'automake-1.15' is missing on your
 system' so I did [autoreconf -f -i] and then did [make]. Command CC was 
executed which is used to compile the source file

9. Next I did [/u/cs/ugrad/dhakshin/assign4/coreutilscopy/bin/ls -a -A]
 and [/u/cs/ugrad/dhakshin/assign4/coreutilscopy/bin/ls -A -a], the first
 command did not output . and .. while the second one did (-a did not override)
