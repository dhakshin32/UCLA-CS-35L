Q1. The performance is improved since the command's flags work consistently 
and work in the order that they are given so the output is distinct based on
 which flag is used last. Since we are removing an if statement in the patch
 then we technically improve the performance since there is one less check but
 this is negligible.

Q2. Since we applied a patch, other files could have been modified which could
 create unexpected behavior. So the patch needs to be checked thoroughly. Also other
 files that depend on the patched files may not work due to changes.

Q3. When run on /dev/null, there is an error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.14/lib/python2.7/
random.py", line 277, in 
  choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # 
raises IndexError if seq is 	
    empty
IndexError: list index out of range

In the chooseline function, where it returns 
'seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]', since the
 file is empty, when it does seq[index] it returns 
an error since seq is empty and there is no index to access.

Q4. When using python3 I did [python3 ./randline.py 
/dev/null] and it gave me the error:
File "/w/home.27/cs/ugrad/dhakshin/assign4/./randline.py", 
line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

In python3 the syntax is changed to something like except 
IOError as err so the code in the current python2 script is
 not backward compatible with python3

Q5. When I run with python2, there is no error. This is because
 all of the code that I used is backward compatible and I did not
 use anything that was outdated/changed in python3
