1. First I did [wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall20/cs35L/
assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz]

2. Next I did [gunzip coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz] followed by 
[tar -xvf coreutils-with-bug.tar] to unzip the file

3. Next I did [./configure--prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/dhakshin/assign5/coreutilscopy]

4. Next I did [make] got this error:

utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
    2 | int futimens (int, char const *, struct timespec const [2]);
      |     ^~~~~~~~
In file included from utimecmp.h:25,
                 from utimecmp.c:25:
/usr/include/sys/stat.h:373:12: note: previous declaration of 'futimens' was here
  373 | extern int futimens (int __fd, const struct timespec __times[2]) __THROW;
      |            ^~~~~~~~

This error was thrown because there were two functions with the same name but 
different parameter

5. Next I downloaded the patch [wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall20/
cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff]

6. Next I applied the patch by doing [patch -p0 < patch.diff] and did [make] 
then [make install]

There were no problems because the patch renamed one of the futimens functions 
to coreutils_futimens, and another function tee to coreutils_tee. This prevented
 the error in which was thrown before when tried to redefine a function with the same name

7. Next to recreate the problem I created three files with different timestamps
 by doing the following steps

[touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' /run/user/$(id -u)/stamp-wwi-armistice]
[touch /run/user/$(id -u)/stamp-now]
[sleep 1]
[touch /run/user/$(id -u)/stamp-now1]

8. Next I did [TZ=UTC0 /u/cs/ugrad/dhakshin/assign5/coreutilscopy/bin/ls -lt 
--full-time /run/user/$(id -u)/stamp*] which output the file from 1918 first, 
despite it being the oldest.

9. Next I did [gdb /u/cs/ugrad/dhakshin/assign5/coreutilscopy/bin/ls]

10. I first did [break main] then executed the program by doing [run -lt 
--full-time /run/user/$(id -u)/stamp*]

11. I did [next] until I saw sort_files and then I did [step]

12. While stepping through this I saw that it called another function from 
func = sort_reverse ? rev_cmp_mtime : compare_mtime; So I did [break compare_mtime] 
and ran it again using [run -lt --full-time /run/user/$(id -u)/stamp*]

13. I did [next] until I got to the function compare_mtime(). I then did [list] to
 see the code in that function which calculated the time difference between the 
files by doing int diff = timespec_cmp (get_stat_mtime (&b->stat). I then wanted 
to investigate timespec_cmp() 

14. I did [next] until I got to the point where timespec_cmp() was called and then did [step]

15. I did [list] to see the code for timespec_cmp()(which was located in timespec.h)
 and saw that the time of file a was being subtracted from b in int 
diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec; I did [print diff] and saw that the number was a positive
 value. This was because the date for wwi-armistice is so far in the past so our diff
 value is negative but due to the fact this negative integer is so large, there 
becomes overflow which makes it a positive integer.

16. I then did [q] to quit gdb

17. Now time to create a patch. I went to coreutils with bug 
[cd /u/cs/ugrad/dhakshin/assign5/coreutils-with-bug]. Next I found the timspec.h file 
in the lib directory [cd lib] and copied it into my main folder by doing 
[cp timespec.h /u/cs/ugrad/dhakshin/assign5]

18. I made another copy of this by doing [cp timespec.h timespec2.h]

19. Next I did emacs timespec.h and edited the code to create a if statement 
that returns a positive number if a>b, negative number if a<b, and 0 if a==b.

20. Next I created a diff by doing [diff -u timespec2.h timespec.h > change.diff] 
and did C-x 4 a to make a change log entry.

21. Next I moved this file by doing [mv change.diff /u/cs/ugrad/dhakshin/assign5/coreutils-with-bug/lib]

22. Next I applied the patch using patch -p0 < change.diff

23. Next I did [make] then [make install]

24. When I redid the command [TZ=UTC0 /u/cs/ugrad/dhakshin/assign5/coreutilscopy/bin/ls 
-lt --full-time /run/user/$(id -u)/stamp*] the output showed stamp-wwi-armistice file last 
 so we know that it is working correctly

25. Reproducing in home directory: [touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice] 
then [touch now] then [sleep 1] then [touch now1] then [TZ=UTC0 ~/coreutils/bin/ls 
-lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1]

This output the wwi-armistice file at the top despite it having the oldest date, 
which is incorrect. The date for this file shows up as 2054 despite entering 1918 
when we first created the file. So the SEASnet server is not correct either.
